# ceilidh-band-tunebook
Clan MacColin Ceilidh Band: We are a group of musicians who play traditional Irish and Scottish tunes on traditional instruments.

This is the offical respository for the band's tune book. I wanted a more controllable way to track changes.

The folder structure is
* ceildh-band-tunebook
  * ABC - abc music files.
  * PDFs - sheet music created from the abc files which become individual pages in the tune book.
  * Misc ABC - abc music files for tunes not added to the tunebook.
  * Misc Tunes - sheet music created from the abc files in the Misc ABC folder.
  * template files - Use to create cover sheet and TOC.
  * dance show tune book - latest project creating a tune book for the MacColin Dance Show.
  * A pdf copy of the the current version of the tunebook.
  * a pdf copy of the MacColin Dance Show set list.
  * A image of the band tshirt.

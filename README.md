# ceilidh-band-tunebook
Clan MacColin Ceilidh Band: We are a group of musicians who play traditional Irish and Scottish tunes on traditional instruments.

This is the official repository for the band's tunebook. I wanted a more controllable way to track changes. I am now
working on the MacColin Dance Show tune book for the 2023 season. See the "dance show tunebook" folder

The folder structure is

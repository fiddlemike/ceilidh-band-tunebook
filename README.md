# ceilidh-band-tunebook
Clan MacColin Ceilidh Band: We are a group of musicians who play traditional Irish and Scottish tunes on traditional instruments.
This is the offical respository for the band's tune book. I wanted a more controllable way to track changes.

The folder structure is
* ceildh-band-tunebook
  * ABC - abc music files
  * PDFs - sheet music created from the abc files which become individual pages in the tune book.
  * template files - Use to create cover sheet and TOC
